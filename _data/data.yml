        abstract: "This study revisits Hsieh and Moretti's (2019) research, extending the original 1964-2009 timeframe to 1964-2019. Using kernel density estimation for land use regulations, housing costs, and employment, we observe improvements in spatial labor misallocation from 2009 to 2019. Also, our study critically reviews the counterfactual estimation procedure of Hsieh and Moretti (2019) and proposes a potential enhancement: iterating the estimation until the indirect utility level equalizes across all locations. Using this new algorithm, we find a significant overstatement in the original estimation of aggregate output growth over 1964-2009 if housing costs were fixed at the 1964 level. Lastly, holding housing costs at the 2009 level, our counterfactual results indicate a 13.9 percentage point smaller output growth for the 1964-2019 period, confirming that spatial misallocation has indeed improved in the recent years"

        abstract: "Sexual assaults and rapes are the costliest types of crime above all other types of crime. Sexual crime leaves intangible costs to society and victims. This paper studies the impact of ridesharing services on the number of sexual crimes in Chicago. By using hourly-community area level ridesharing service pickups and crime data spanning from January 1st to December 31st of 2019, this paper shows that the increase in the ridesharing service is positively correlated with the number of sexual crimes and that the size of the increase in sexual crime varies in different areas of the city and time. The findings of the research can contribute to the policy implication in the ridesharing service industry."

        pdfs:  "&#91;Draft coming soon!&#93;"
        abstract: "We develop a theoretical framework in which segregation, discrimination, and other racialized processes make intergenerational mobility a function of the capital available to one’s broader racial/ethnic group, as in Borjas (1992). We show that racial capital systematically slows the speed of generational convergence for historically unequal groups and that, for any particular racial group, its impact is directly related to the social salience of race in society. We estimate empirical models of intergenerational mobility using data from Opportunity Insights and the NLSY for Asian, Black, Hispanic, and white children born around 1980. Racial capital at the neighborhood and, especially, the metropolitan area levels has a substantial role in explaining Black-white education, income, and employment gaps. It matters about half as much for Hispanic-white differences and very little for Asian-white differences. The inclusion of racial capital in the model sharply closes, and in many cases reverses, the Black-white and Hispanic-white intergenerational mobility gaps documented in Chetty et al. (2020). These results imply that (1) observed racial outcome gaps are largely a function of historical inequities in available capital (more broadly construed here to include neighborhood/metro racial capital in addition to one’s own parents) and (2) racial capital -- and, more fundamentally, the continued social salience of race -- plays a crucial role in explaining the historically slow speed of generational convergence to Black-white equality in the United States. Relative to existing estimates, our results are more suggestive of the eventual convergence to racial equality, albeit at a glacial pace.  "

        abstract: "In the U.S., Black and white households with identical incomes live in neighborhoods characterized by vastly different economic resources.  This racial neighborhood inequality is present in every major metropolitan area and at all points of the income distribution. We document these patterns using neighborhood income as a summary measure of economic resources and highlight where this form of racial inequality is especially severe. We then examine a series of potential explanatory mechanisms for neighborhood inequality, including decentralized racial sorting, housing discrimination, and racial differences in wealth and home ownership. We conclude with a discussion of how the separate and unequal geography of the American housing market contributes to intergenerational mobility and the speed of racial economic convergence in the United States."
